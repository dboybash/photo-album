# LT Tech Showcase - Photo Album

Purpose - Photo album exercise for LT Tech Showcase


About:
This is my first tangible exercise using a web service and using the rest template.  In order to complete this exercise, I first thing I did was to review the exercise specs and devise a rough plan of what I would need to execute.  Next, I decided to consult online resources and personal references, whom have experience, to try obtaining a better understanding of web services and how to consume.  After consulting resources and reviewing the data residing @ "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos", I refined my high-level plan to the following:
1. create a class to build photo objects and handle attributes (metadata).
2. create a class to process the data coming from the web service. 
3. create a class to execute the program.

Using TDD principles I was able to follow my plan and develop each class, building on each step in order to execute the end result.
